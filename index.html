<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p><span class="b u">www</span>: I decided to force/redirect all web traffic to this www portion because people often associate www with a website, and not everyone is aware '.gg' is a valid top-level domain much like '.com' or '.net', for example.</p>
<p><span class="b u">1r1s</span>: My name is often misspelled, mispronounced, miscapitalized, and often all done deliberately by those in power and authority out of spite, malice, incompetence, and ignorance. This part signifies and codifies that my name is spelled with 1 'r' and 1 's'.</p>
<p><span class="b u">gg</span>: I had decided to go with '.gg' because I was worried while planning my website '1r1s' would be considered a 'premium' domain and I didn't want to pay an absurd amount of money for those. '.gg' doesn't have 'premium' domains, but it turns out '1r1s' wasn't considered 'premium' by my domain registrar. I decided to stick with '.gg' anyway. I lovingly joke that it's short for 'good girl'. *gets head pats*</p>
<p>I wanted to have a lil' slice o' web to call my own, so I made a website. This is the website's second incarnation, reborn like a Phoenix, rising from the ashes.</p>
